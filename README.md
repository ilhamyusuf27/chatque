Chatque is a simple, frontend-only chat application built with **Vue.js** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to select a chat room, view messages, and send new ones in a clean, modern interface. This project was developed as a technical assessment for a frontend engineer position.

## Features

- **Room List**: View all available chat rooms with their last message and timestamp.
- **Dynamic Chat View**: Select any room to instantly view its message history.
- **Message Input**: Send messages easily with an auto-resizing text area.
- **Modern Chat Layout**: A bottom-anchored, reverse-scrolling message list ensures the latest messages are always in view.
- **URL Routing**: Access specific chat rooms directly via their URL (e.g., `/chat/room-123`).
- **Persistent Messages**: Chat history is saved to the browser's local storage, so messages are not lost on page reload.
